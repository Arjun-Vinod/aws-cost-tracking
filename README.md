# AWS Cost Tracker
## Project Overview

AWS Cost Dashboard is a serverless project that tracks and visualizes your AWS spending in real-time. It uses AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR), S3, Lambda, CloudWatch, and SNS to provide a dynamic dashboard and email alerts when your costs exceed a threshold.

## Features

- Automated cost tracking: Aggregates AWS spending from CUR files.

- Real-time updates: Lambda processes new CUR files automatically.

- CloudWatch alerts: Sends notifications via SNS when spending exceeds a set threshold.

- Static dashboard: Visualizes total and per-service costs via a hosted S3 static website.

### S3 Bucket Structure
```bash
  bucket-name/
  ├── dashboard/                # static website
  │   ├── index.html
  │   └── summary.json          # generated by Lambda
  └── cost-usage-report/        # CUR files uploaded here
```

## Technologies Used

- **AWS S3** – hosting static dashboard and storing CUR files

- **AWS Lambda** – processing CUR and generating summary JSON

- **AWS CloudWatch** – monitoring costs and Lambda execution

- **AWS SNS** – sending email notifications for spending thresholds

- **Python 3.10** – Lambda runtime for CUR processing

## Setup & Usage

1. Create S3 Buckets

    - Bucket for CUR files: `cost-usage-report/` folder

    - Bucket for dashboard: `dashboard/` folder hosting index.html

2. Enable Static Website Hosting

    - Go to S3 → dashboard folder → Properties → Static website hosting

    - Set Index document: `index.html`

3. Lambda Setup

    - Runtime: Python 3.10

    - Attach IAM role with permissions:

        - s3:GetObject → cost-usage-report/*

        - s3:PutObject → dashboard/*

    - S3 trigger:

      - Bucket: <bucket-name>

      - Prefix: cost-usage-report/

      - Event: PUT

4. Lambda Function Logic

    - Reads .csv.gz CUR files

    - Aggregates total and per-service costs

    - Writes summary.json into /dashboard/ folder for dashboard consumption

5. CloudWatch Alarm

    - Create alarm on EstimatedCharges metric

    - Set threshold → trigger SNS notifications

6. Dashboard

    - Browser fetches summary.json from /dashboard/ folder

    - Displays total costs and per-service breakdown

  
## Learning Outcomes

- Hands-on with AWS serverless architecture

- Practical experience with CUR, S3, Lambda, CloudWatch, SNS

- Learned serverless dashboard design for monitoring costs
